# Log level for mod_rewrite

# Disable default caching headers
#
# The following headers are set by default dispatcher configuration Expires, Cache-Control, Age.
# If you uncomment and define DISABLE_DEFAULT_CACHING variable these headers are not set any more
# and you can fully customize the caching behavior.
#
Define DISABLE_DEFAULT_CACHING

# Enable caching for GraphQL persisted queries
#
# By default, GraphQL persisted query responses are not cached in dispatcher.
# If you uncomment and define CACHE_GRAPHQL_PERSISTED_QUERIES variable, then persisted query results
# will be cached in dispatcher. Using CORS, in that case, will require additional dispatcher configuration.
#
# Define CACHE_GRAPHQL_PERSISTED_QUERIES

# Enable CORS handling in the dispatcher
#
# By default, CORS is handled by the AEM publish server.
# If you uncomment and define the ENABLE_CORS variable, then CORS will be handled in the dispatcher.
# See the default.vhost file for a suggested dispatcher configuration. Note that:
#   a. You will need to adapt the regex from default.vhost to match your CORS domains
#   b. Remove the "Origin" header (if it exists) from the clientheaders.any file
#   c. If you have any CORS domains configured in your AEM publish server origin, you have to move those to the dispatcher
#       (i.e. accordingly update regex in default.vhost to match those domains)
#
